## #1
Cream cheese 350g melts in room temperature til they are easy to stir.

## #2
Add 90g of sugar. This is a reduced amount and the cake would taste good.

## #3
Add the two eggs and one egg yolk one by one. Adding only one egg yolk is to make the cheesecake less sponge; adding three whole eggs also works.
