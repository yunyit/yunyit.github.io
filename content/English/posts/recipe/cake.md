> Size: 6 inch round cake tin

# Ingredients
- Cream Cheese 350g
- Sugar 90g
- 2 Eggs + 1 Egg Yolk
- Cream 150g
- Low Gluten Flour (Corn Flour works well too!) 10g

# Method

1. Cream cheese 350g melts in room temperature til they are easy to stir.

2. Add 90g of sugar. This is a reduced amount and the cake would taste good.

3. Add the two eggs and one egg yolk one by one. Adding only one egg yolk is to make the cheesecake less sponge; adding three whole eggs also works.

4. Add 150g of cream. Mix them well in each step.

5. Add 10g of cake flour or corn flour. If using bread flour or all purpose flour, the cheesecake will be more sponge.

6. Sift and pour them into the cake tin with two layers of baking paper. Give the tin a sharp bang on the worktop to remove any air bubbles.

7. Pre heat the oven to 230°C. Best tempereture for this cake size and amount of materials is between 230°C and 240°C. 

Bake for less than 30 minutes. The best length of time for baking is between 23 minutes and 25 minutes. 

8. Take the cake out and chill in room temperature. Put the cake in the fridge for one hour or overnight.

Serve with any flavour of ice cream. 

# Mix and match for baking temerature and fridge time

## chill in room temperature 1 hour + fridge overnight
Quite solid. 

Sweep the knife for each cut, to have a clean cut.

## chill in room temperature 1 hour + fridge 1 hour
More soft and a bit lava in the cake centre.

## oven 240°C for 26 minutes
More lava.

# Other flavour
## Blue cheese/Comté cheese
Same ingredients and steps before pouring in the cake tin.

Pour half in the cake tin and add some blue cheese/Comté cheese fractions in the middle of the cake tin. Then pour the second half in the cake tin.

230°C in fan mode oven for 28 minutes. Chill in room temperature and fridge overnight.
