> 6 inch round cake tin

# Ingredients
Cream Cheese 350g
Sugar 90g
2 Eggs + 1 Egg Yolk
Cream 150g
Cake Flour (I use Corn Flour and it works well) 10g

# Method

## STEP 1
Cream cheese 350g melts in room temperature til they are easy to stir.

## STEP 2
Add 90g of sugar. This is a reduced amount and the cake would taste good.

## STEP 3
Add the two eggs and one egg yolk one by one. Adding only one egg yolk is to make the cheesecake less sponge; adding three whole eggs also works.

## STEP 4
Add 150g of cream. Mix them well in each step.

## STEP 5 
Add 10g of cake flour or corn flour. If using bread flour or all purpose flour, the cheesecake will be more sponge.

## STEP 6
Sift and pour them into the cake tin with two layers of baking paper. Give the tin a sharp bang on the worktop to remove any air bubbles.

## STEP 7
Pre heat the oven to 230°C. Best tempereture for this cake size and amount of materials is between 230°C and 240°C. 

Bake for less than 30 minutes. The best length of time for baking is between 23 minutes and 25 minutes. 

## STEP 8
Take the cake out and cool it down in room temperature. Put the cake in the fridge for one hour or overnight.
