# Winter Pasture
>One Woman's Journey with China's Kazakh Herders 

by Li Juan, Jack Hargreaves (Translator), and Yan Yan (Translator)

'Encouraged by her neighbors, Li decides to join a family of Kazakh herders as they take their 30 boisterous camels, 500 sheep, and over 100 cattle and horses to pasture for the winter.' It's a cold lonely journey but also a warm family journey into the freezing-cold Kazakh winter pasture. It's amazing that her words bring me so vividly into the unfamiliar Kazakh land in a cold winter in the hot summer when I first finished reading it, and I feel eager to reread it in an actually cold winter now. Her words are like snow, seemingly weightless, but silently nourishing the earth. Life and talent have given Juan a unique sense of perception of the Kazakh world.
